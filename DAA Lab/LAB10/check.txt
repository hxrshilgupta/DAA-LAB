Write a code in C for given a directed graph G (V, E) and a starting vertex ‘s’.
● Determine the lengths of the shortest paths from the starting vertex ‘s’ to all other vertices in the graph G using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
● Display the shortest path from the given source ‘s’ to all other vertices.

(Note# Nodes will be numbered consecutively from 1 to n (user input), and edges will have varying distances or lengths. The graph G can be read from an input file “inDiAdjMat1.dat” that contains non-negative cost adjacency matrix. The expected output could be as per the sample format.)

Content of the input file “inDiAdjMat1.dat” could be
0 10 0 5 0
0 0 1 2 0
0 0 0 0 4
3 0 9 0 2
7 0 6 0 0

Input:
Enter the Number of Vertices: 5
Enter the Source Vertex: 1
Output:
Source      Destination      Cost       Path
1                1            0           -
1                2            8         1->4->2
1                3            9         1->4->2->3
1                4            5         1->4
1                5            7         1->4->5
